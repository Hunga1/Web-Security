# Web Security
#### Author: Aaron Hung

## Purpose
This repository houses scripts and other source material for securing a web server. After working on several web applications for fun on my spare time, I've noticed that I spent considerable time configuring the environment to be secure while still allowing other people to access and try out the sites. This project is meant to make it easy to secure your web server environment and quickly get to developing your web application.

## Additional Notes
Some of these scripts were written and tested only in certain OS environments and web server vendors. Please read the script's header to ensure that it will work for your environment.
